Hey Akerboya,

Here is some information to test the scripts. read the ream.de file in this same repository. Simply:

1. Login as root.
2. Create a user.
3. Run scripts as root.
4. su as the user
5. Run Deviantd and confirm it's good.

CREATE A USER ON EACH SERVER

adduser dev1

**************************************
* Test Server1 for Script (dev1.sh)
**************************************
IP: 45.32.219.36
user: root
password: G?3sTE$b3TyR*5Fg


NOTE: To speed things up for you, I have loaded a compiled version that will work on this server. So instead of the ftp 
instructions in the ream.de, simply do the following from the directory you will run the script:

step1:
wget http://blivv.com/Deviantd

step2:
chmod +x Deviantd

*************************************
* Test Server2 for Script 2 (dev2.sh)
*************************************
IP: 108.61.202.7
user: root
password: b8W+D*wtcn4ghBNd
